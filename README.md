# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
This repository will be used for my HTML and CSS projects with The Tech Academy. All of my coursework involving HTML and CSS will be here.

### Portfolio Website
This is the first version of my portfolio website, which can be found [here](https://jeffstop.github.io/). This version of the webpage uses CSS for styling and includes a video background on loop, images, links, a navbar, and a contact form.
### Other Projects
Most of the files found in this repository were practice for html and css. Each one is focused on a different topic to get familiar with html and css.
