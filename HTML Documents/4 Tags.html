					<p>Space is endless. There's just so much... space. Does time pass the same way out there as it
					does here? If it's <time>06:00</time> here could it be the same out there? Is <time datetime="2021-12-25 08:00"> Christmas 
					at the same time in space? I don't know I'm not a science doer.</p>
